Original mod: [here](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/tree/master/data/mods/Aftershock)
This is a version of the mod for CDDA 0.G that tries to remove the "total conversion" parts of the mod.

Changes for now:
- remove all the formless ruins, that were way too common (~220 overmap tiles with 1 "reveal map" command)
